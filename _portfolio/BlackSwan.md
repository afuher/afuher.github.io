Developed a sophisticated neural network classification model inspired by the work of Nassim Nicholas Taleb to predict "Black Swan" events in equities markets. This model utilizes daily trading history and sentiment analysis to identify potential market disruptions and predict their impact on asset prices. To support this complex analysis, I built a robust data pipeline that scrapes, cleans, and processes all relevant data in real-time. This approach to market analysis represents a powerful tool for investors and financial institutions looking to manage risk and capitalize on market volatility.
