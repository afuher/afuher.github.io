Developed a robust data pipeline that pulls data using API and processes it for predictive modeling. Using this pipeline, built a predictive model that accurately predicts the probability of flight delays for a given route and time. To enable efficient data exploration and insights, we linked the data to an interactive Tableau dashboard that allows users to visualize and interact with the data in real-time. This approach to data analysis and visualization is crucial for airlines, travel agencies, and other stakeholders who rely on accurate and timely information to make informed decisions.
