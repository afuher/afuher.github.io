 Python package that utilizes variate transformations to generate pseudo-random numbers for both discrete and continuous distributions from uniformly generated variables. Our package implements various transformation techniques, including inverse transform, empirical distributions, convolution, and acceptance-rejection. This approach to random variate generation is essential in the fields of simulation, modeling, and statistics, where accurate and efficient random sampling is necessary for meaningful analysis and decision-making.
